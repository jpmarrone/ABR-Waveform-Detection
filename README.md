## Project Description
A convolutional neural network to detect waveforms (peaks and troughs) in two channel auditory brainstem response (ABR) recordings. ABRs measure the neural activity elicited by various auditory stimuli. Channel 1 has visible wave 1 and wave 3 responses. Channel 2 has visible wave 1, 4, 5, and 6 responses. The training and testing data set consists of 772 signals (for both channel 1 and channel 2) recorded in response to a click auditory stimuli. Data provided by Central Auditory Lab (Dr. Edward Bartlett) at Purdue University.
